          Strong pull toward Programing
        </div>
        <div className='text-white text-lg font-semibold'>
          While not having education about programing there was somthing that always attracted me toward stuff related to tech. Some of it might be because of my interst in problem solving. i might not be best in problem soilving but i try my best.
          It all started when i came in contact with computer in school. While i choose or rather my parent choose a diffrent education field for me, i Was always up to date with new tech news. My love towrds computers also helped in me landing my current job insted of my collage education.
